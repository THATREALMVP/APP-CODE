<h2>How to make the chocolate cake</h2>
<p>We can prepare the cake batter in three simple steps</p>

<h4><i>1.Mix together all the powdered ingredients</i></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Into a bowl, add in the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder.</li>
    <li>Mix them together so that the baking powder gets evenely distributed in the four.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>2.Mix together all the rest of the ingredients in another bowl</i></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Into a bowl, add in the softened unsalted butter and sugar.</li>
    <li>Cream them together until they become light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the vanilla extract and eggs (one at a time).</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>3.Combine the wet and dry ingredients</i></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients into the bowl and combine them together.</li>
    <li>We need to add the chopped chocolates into this and mix them together.</li>
    <li>Now our cake batter is ready.</li>
    <li>Transfer the batter on to a greased baking pan.</li>
    <li>Take it into the oven</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Baking the cake</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bake the chocolate cake at 350 F for 60-70 minutes</li>
    <li>You can check the doneness of cake, by poking a skewer into the center of the cake and if comes out clean, our cake is done.</li>
    <li>If you want to top the chocolate cake with some chocolate ganache ,you can make it in a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to make chocolate sauce for topping the chocolate cake</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Just pour in 120 ml or 1/2 cup of hot heavy whipping cream to 130g or 3/4 cup of finely chopped chocolate.</li>
    <li>Whisk them while it is still hot.</li>
    <li>The chocolate will melt in a minute and you will get a beautiful chocolate sauce.</li>
    <li>It will thicken upon cooling.</li>
    <li>If the chocolate is not finely chopped, there are chances that they may not melt evenly and the sauce will have few lumps here and there.</li>
    <li>So take care to chop the chocolate finely.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>Enjoy!</i></b></h4>
