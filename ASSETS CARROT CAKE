<h2>How to make the chocolate cake</h2>
<p>We can prepare the cake batter in these simple steps</p>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
    Butter two 9" round cake pans, line with parchment paper, butter parchment paper, dust parchment paper with flour, shake out excess.*
    Line pans with water soaked cake strips if you have them.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer blend together vegetable oil, applesauce, eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Add dry ingredients and mix until combined. Mix in grated carrots just to evenly distribute. Divide mixture evenly into 2 prepared cake pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheat oven for 33 - 38 minutes until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool 10 minutes in cake pan, then run a knife around edges of cakes and invert into a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Frost cakes then finish with chopped pecans if using. Store cake in airtight container in refrigerator.</li>
    <li><b>For the frosting:</b>In a suitable bowl of large mixer, place powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, and margarine.
        Beat at second speed until thoroughly blended. Hold refrigerated and use as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i>How to Decorate Carrot Cake</i></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add a swirled frosting finish done by hand using an offset spatula and adding a border of chopped pecans covering the entire outside edge.
        It’s helpful to use a cake turntable when decorating.</li>
    <li>Tint some of the frosting green and some orange. Then I do a grid-like decoration of oranges rows on the top of the cake,
        followed by piping a green life-like border around the top edge</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><b><i>Enjoy!</i></b></h4>
